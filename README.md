# SmartPlantFactory-
This is an implementation of a semi-autonomous plant factory system which is able to self-regulate
1. Temperature and Humidity
2. pH
3. Water refill
4. Lighting (LEDs)

Besides these, it has additional plant health monitoring and growth tracking capabilities. Both of which employed the use of OpenCV, Tensorflow and Keras to implement. The Convolutional Neural Network trained was able to classify 5 different crop types with an accuracy of 70 % (could still be improved). 

Arduino Mega 2560 and Raspberry Pi Model 3B+ were used.
